Example of use dictionary based on red-black Binary Search Tree in C# with C5 library.

C5 - library for C# which add lot of collection types. It's project at IT University of Copenhagen. https://github.com/sestoft/C5


C5 has class C5/trees/TreeDictionary.cs but it's not finished at the moment (13.08.2023).
Here I put simple example how to use same functionality based on existing class - C5/trees/TreeSet.cs


Look at usingTreeSetAsDictionary.cs in this repository.
Solution based on unfinished C5/trees/TreeDictionary.cs class.
